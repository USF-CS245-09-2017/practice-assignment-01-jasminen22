# CS245 - Practice Assignment 1

By Jasmine Nava.
In this assignment I have two classes called Fibonacci.java and Factorial.java. In both of these classes there are two functions, an iterative one and a recursive one. If the type that is passed into the (fibonacci or factorial) function is iterative then the iterative function is called. If the type is recursive then the recursive function is called. Practice1Test.java checks whether the implementatons successfully produce the expected values.
